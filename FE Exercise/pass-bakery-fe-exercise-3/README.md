# Pass Bakery Front-end project.

## Challenge 3

### Description
In exercise 2, we made some very basic styles for our menu. For exercise 3, we're going to up our game a few notches with many custom styles. Our menu will morph from a simple paper menu into an online order form like _Toast Tab_.

Steps we will take are
* Make our lists appear in two columns
* Add buttons to each 
* Style text content

### Technical Considerations
As stated above, we will be loosely mimicking the popular online ordering tool, Toast Tab. Here is are some example bakery Toast Tab order pages
`https://www.toasttab.com/sub-rosa-bakery-620-n-25th-st/v3/`
`https://www.toasttab.com/tatte-bakery-clarendon/v3/`

Check the directory exercises/images for image files to use in your page.

For the purposes of this exercise all numeric CSS values should be set to `0`, `1`, `2`, `4` or a multiple of `8`. This will make it easier for you to choose the correct values that matchh the mock. It will give you practice working within the rules of a larger design system.
